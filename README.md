# SimpleCxxLib

 The `SimpleCxxLib` package is a simple C++ library for introductory CS which is currently being used in [CS101: Programming Abstractions in C++](https://cs101.stickmind.com) course. This is a fork from [the Stanford C++ libraries](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/StanfordCPPLib/) originally developed by Eric Roberts and Keith Schwarz.

## Documentation

- [The Simple C++ Libraries](https://cppdoc.stickmind.com/)

## Environment

The `SimpleCxxLib` package interacts with Java graphics, so `Java` is needed for running programs properly.

- [Install JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)

## How to use it

Using this libary, you can test all the examples in the excellent book [**Programming Abstractions in C++**](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/books/ProgrammingAbstractionsInC++/) by Eric Roberts.
