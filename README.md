# SimpleCxxLib

 The `SimpleCxxLib` package is a simple C++ library for introductory CS which is currently being used in [CSE-CS101](https://www.stickmind.com/courses.html) course. This is a fork from [the Stanford C++ libraries](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/StanfordCPPLib/) originally developed by Eric Roberts and Keith Schwarz.

## Documentation

- [The Simple C++ Libraries](https://cppdoc.stickmind.com/)

## Environment

`Qt Creator` is an integrated development environment (IDE) with tools to edit, build, run, and debug programs. The latest Qt 6 is strongly recommended.

- [Install Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)

The `SimpleCxxLib` libraries also interact with Java, so `Java 8` is needed for running programs properly.

- [Install JDK 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8)

## How to use it

Using this libary, you can test all the examples in the excellent book [**Programming Abstractions in C++**](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/books/ProgrammingAbstractionsInC++/) by Eric Roberts.
