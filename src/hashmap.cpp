/*
 * Implementation notes: hashCode
 * ------------------------------
 * This function takes a string key and uses it to derive a hash code,
 * which is a nonnegative integer related to the key by a deterministic
 * function that distributes keys well across the space of integers.
 * The general method is called linear congruence, which is also used
 * in random-number generators.  The specific algorithm used here is
 * called djb2 after the initials of its inventor, Daniel J. Bernstein,
 * Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
