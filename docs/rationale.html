<hr>
This document is the latest in a series of design documents outlining
changes in the Stanford C++ libraries used for CS&nbsp;106B and
CS&nbsp;106X.
The original design document appeared on July 26, 2011, and has since
been modified after a series of discussions with Keith Schwarz, Steve
Cooper, and Jerry Cain, as well as with the experience of teaching these
courses several times in the interim.

<h2>1. Overall philosophy</h2>

Over the years, I've become convinced that most CS
instructors&mdash;for reasons that are not by any means impossible to
understand&mdash;are so hostile to the idea of externally developed
libraries that they will choose a demonstrably unsuccessful standard
approach over a nonstandard one, no matter how successful the
nonstandard approach has been.
I am therefore trying to walk a fine line in the textbook.
My goal is to make it <i>appear</i> standard even as I provide
instructors with the tools they need to solve the pedagogical problems
associated with trying to teach in a purely standard way.
The programs in Chapter&nbsp;1 follow reasonably standard conventions
For example, the <code>HelloWorld.cpp</code> program looks pretty much
as it would in any traditional C++ textbook:

<pre class=codefigure>
<span class=comment>/*
 * File: HelloWorld.cpp
 * --------------------
 * This file is adapted from the example
 * on page 1 of Kernighan and Ritchie's
 * book The C Programming Language.
 */</span>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
   cout &lt;&lt; "hello, world" &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0;
}
</pre>

I then introduce the various libraries at different points in the text.
Whenever possible, I introduce each new library by defining and
implementing at least a part of its interface.
For example, Chapter&nbsp;2 defines and implements the interfaces
<a href="error.html"><code>error.h</code></a> (in a slightly simpler
form that doesn't involve exceptions),
<a href="random.html"><code>random.h</code></a>, and
<a href="gmath.html"><code>gmath.h</code></a>.
Once I've introduced each new library interface, I can then use it
in programs throughout the rest of the book.

<p>The advantage of this strategy is twofold.
First, given that they've seen how the library works, students
(and, of course, potential adopters) get a sense that the library is not
something magical that they've been given but instead something
that they could have built on their own.
Second, building only part of a library provides a ready supply of
exercises, because you can ask students to complete the implementation
of the interface.

<p>Unfortunately, I can't apply this strategy to every library
interface.
The significant exceptions are the collection classes and the graphics
libraries.
The success of the Stanford approach in recent years is due, at least in
part, to the fact that we teach students to use the collection classes
as clients before looking at the various possible implementations.
It is therefore important <i>not</i> to develop implementations of these
classes before students have a chance to understand how to use them
effectively.
The graphics libraries, by contrast, are beyond the scope of the textbook.
It's great to have them in order to create more exciting
assignments, but it is unrealistic to think that students in
<nobr>CS<font size=-3>&nbsp;</font>106B</nobr> can develop them on their
own.

<p>In light of the fact that collection classes and the graphics
libraries represent departures from the strategies used for the rest of
the library packages, I've separated out the discussion of these
packages.
Section&nbsp;2 outlines the changes in the other library packages,
section&nbsp;3 covers the collection classes, and section&nbsp;4 looks
at the graphics libraries.

<h2>2. Changes in the basic libraries</h2>

This section and the individual subsections that follow outline the
changes I've made in the library packages other than the
collection classes.

<p>One change that I've made systematically is to standardize the
naming conventions for identifiers.
In the old versions of the libraries, the names of methods began with
lowercase letters, but free functions started with uppercase letters.
In the new versions of the libraries, all function and method names
begin with a lowercase letter, which follows what seems to have become
standard practice.
Similarly, constant names were sometimes spelled entirely in uppercase
and sometimes in mixed case.
In the new libraries, all constant names&mdash;including the names of
enumerated constants&mdash;are in uppercase.

<p>I've also abandoned the suffix-<code>T</code> convention I
used to use for type names below the level of classes.
In the new version of the textbook, I use initial-uppercase names for all
defined types.
Thus, instead of the enumerated type <code>directionT</code>, I now use
<code>Direction</code>.
Similarly, in the implementation of linked lists and trees, I use the
type names <code>Cell</code> and <code>Node</code> in place of
<code>cellT</code> and <code>nodeT</code>.

<p>While there may be a semantic loss here, I decided it was hard to
justify naming structs one way and classes another, given that the two
facilities are implemented in essentially the same way in modern C++ (a
<code>struct</code> is simply a <code>class</code> in which the default
visibility is <code>public</code>).
Once I took structs out of the picture, having a distinct naming
convention for enumerated types seemed wrong.

<p>Since version 1.1, I have also made the
libraries <code>const</code>-correct.
This change makes them much more efficient, but also makes it possible
for instructors who want to introduce <code>const</code> early to do so.
The textbook now introduces <code>const</code> (other than to identify
constant values) in Chapter 14 and then uses it in the remaining chapters.

<h3>2.1 The elimination of <code>genlib.h</code></h3>

One of the critical steps I needed to take in order to make the textbook
more attractive to potential adopters was eliminating the need to have a
nonstandard library in <i>every</i> piece of code, which is true
for <code>genlib.h</code> under the old model.
I've adopted the simplest possible expedient in this regard and
have eliminated the <code>genlib.h</code> interface entirely.
In practical terms, the only effect on students is that they now have to
include the line

<pre>
    using namespace std;
</pre>

after their imports.
I have thus exchanged one required line for another.
The difference is that the new line is part of the C++ standard.

<p>One of the most difficult decisions in this design, however, has been
that of where to place the

<pre>
    using namespace std;
</pre>

directive.
Most C++ programmers write this <i>after</i> the library inclusions.
The text follows that convention.

<p>Unfortunately, the cost of this decision is that the <code>.h</code>
files the students write must explicitly qualify any identifiers that come
from the <code>std</code> namespace.  For example, <code>.h</code>
files need to refer to <code>std::string</code> instead of the
unqualified type name <code>string</code>.  Students, however, write
fewer interfaces than implementations.
As a result, it seems wiser to make the implementations appear more
standard even if doing so adds some complexity to the interfaces.

<p>A more subtle issue that arises in eliminating <code>genlib.h</code>
is that <code>genlib.h</code> also redefined <code>main</code> so as to
execute special initialization code before calling the student's
program, such as bringing up the console and responding to uncaught
error exceptions.
That redefinition is now distributed across the header files that need
it, including <code>console.h</code>, <code>gwindow.h</code>, and
<code>error.h</code>.
If you include any of these header files, <code>main</code> gets
redefined so that the right things happen.

<h3>2.2 The <code>simpio.h</code> library</h3>

The <a href="simpio.html"><code>simpio.h</code></a> library has been
with us since 1992, when it was necessary to get around the many
problems in C's <code>scanf</code> function.
Given my goal of avoiding libraries until I can build them, I
don't use <code>simpio.h</code> in the first two chapters of the
book, and instead use the C++ extraction operator, as in the
<code>Average3</code> program from Chapter&nbsp;1:

<pre class=codefigure>
<span class=comment>/*
 * File: Average3.cpp
 * ------------------
 * This program averages three integers.
 */</span>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int n1, n2, n3;
   cout &lt;&lt; "This program averages three integers." &lt;&lt; endl;
   cout &lt;&lt; "1st integer: ";
   cin &gt;&gt; n1;
   cout &lt;&lt; "2nd integer: ";
   cin &gt;&gt; n2;
   cout &lt;&lt; "3rd integer: ";
   cin &gt;&gt; n3;
   double average = (n1 + n2 + n3) / 3.0;
   cout &lt;&lt; "The average is " &lt;&lt; average &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0;
}
</pre>

Using the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, however, raises many of the
old <code>scanf</code> issues.
For one thing, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> provides no error checking and
recovery in the way that the <code>simpio.h</code> functions do.
Perhaps more critically, the treatment of whitespace is extremely
confusing, and students have a great deal of trouble understanding why
<code>line</code> always ends up as the empty string after executing the
following code:

<pre>
    int n;
    string line;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter an integer: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; n;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a line: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; line;
</pre>

Using <code>simpio.h</code> makes it possible to shorten this code
considerably, as follows:

<pre>
    int n = getInteger("Enter an integer: ");
    string line = getLine("Enter a line: ");
</pre>

This version also solves the problem of checking the numeric input for
validity, because <code>getInteger</code> performs that checking internally.

<p>My guess, however, is that most adopters won't use
<code>simpio.h</code> even after I build it in Chapter&nbsp;4.
In that chapter, I talk about the problems in the use of the
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator and then build <code>simpio.h</code> as a
fix.
I plan to stick with that strategy, but not to push the point too
firmly.

<h3>2.3 The <code>strlib.h</code> interface</h3>

In addition to renaming this interface from <code>strutils.h</code> to
<a href="strlib.html"><code>strlib.h</code></a> to promote greater
uniformity in my naming conventions, I've also added several new
functions from Java's string libraries that I can no longer live
without (most notably <code>startsWith</code> and
<code>endsWith</code>).
I've also shortened the names of the case-conversion functions so
that they match their Java counterparts (<code>toUpperCase</code> and
<code>toLowerCase</code>).
In the Version&nbsp;1.0 document, I had proposed having
<code>strlib.h</code> export the functions
<code>toUpperCaseInPlace</code> and <code>toLowerCaseInPlace</code> that
changed their arguments rather than returning a new string.
Several people recommended I leave these out of the interface, and I
have done so.

<p>As most of you know, we've occasionally experienced some odd
problems with the numeric conversion functions like
<code>stringToInteger</code> and <code>integerToString</code> that have
proven impossible to track down.
The problems occur only on the Macintosh and are characterized by a
memory smash inside the code for these functions that happens
<i>before</i> the student's main program even starts.
I'm suspicious that the problem has something to do with the
extremely clever template-based strategy used to implement these
methods.
The new version of the library reimplements these functions in a way
that students will easily be able to understand based on the discussion
of strings and streams in Chapters&nbsp;3 and 4.
We used this implementation in the winter and spring of last year, and
the memory smashes indeed seemed to have disappeared.

<h3>2.4 The <code>random.h</code> library</h3>

I've left most of the
<a href="random.html"><code>random.h</code></a> interface alone, but
have decided to make a rather significant semantic change in the form of
eliminating the <code>randomize</code> function.
Given that so many of our students come with prior knowledge of Java, it
is confusing for them to learn a different initialization model when
they make the transition to C++.
To fix this problem, I have changed the implementation so that the
pseudorandom number generator is initialized by default to a random
point in the sequence.
Clients who want to work with a predictable sequence now need to call
<code>setRandomSeed</code>.

<p>In the interest of enhancing portability (and to avoid some serious
problems in the implementation of <code>rand</code> on several
platforms), I've also rewritten <code>random.cpp</code> so that it
includes its own 32-bit linear congruential generator.
The effect is that the same seed now produces the same sequence on all
platforms.

<h3>2.5 The <code>TokenScanner</code> class</h3>

I've made a rather large number of changes in the existing
<code>Scanner</code> class, starting with changing its name to
<a href="TokenScanner-class.html"><code>TokenScanner</code></a>.
The existing version has the following problems:

<ol>
<li>Students have to learn a new syntactic feature (the <code>::</code>
operator) when they specify options like
<code>Scanner::IgnoreSpaces</code> (although they have arguably seen this
already in <code>string::npos</code>).  Particularly if I maintain
my convention that enumerated constants should be uppercase, calls
like

<pre>
    setSpaceOption(Scanner::IGNORE_SPACES);
</pre>

seem to shout across the screen.

<p><li>The <code>setBracketOption</code> is a holdover from an ancient
assignment and no longer seems relevant.

<p><li>The current version lacks a number of features that we would like
to use, such as multicharacter operators in the BASIC and Scheme
assignments.
</ol>

What I've done here is replace the <code>Scanner</code> class with
a new <code>TokenScanner</code> class that I've got running, with
minor adjustments as required by the language, in C, Java, and
JavaScript.
This version provides simpler methods to specify the options, supports
multicharacter operators, and incorporates several other features
I've needed to get language parsers running.
What I have seems to work well for the applications I've tried
without being significantly more complicated than the current model.

<p>The reason for the change in name is to make it possible to use
the same class name in all the different languages.  The problem with
<code>Scanner</code> is that it creates ambiguity in Java because there
is already a <code>Scanner</code> class in <code>java.util</code>.

<h3>2.6 The <code>filelib.h</code> interface</h3>

There is no current counterpart to the
<a href="filelib.html"><code>filelib.h</code></a> interface, but I have
needed a place to save several of the file-handling functions I use in
the text.
Chapter&nbsp;4 (Streams), for example,
introduces the functions <code>promptUserForFile</code> and
<code>readEntireFile</code>.
The primary purpose of <code>filelib.h</code> is to have an interface
in which to put those functions.
Once that interface exists, it seems useful to include other useful
functions, many of which appear as exercises in Chapter&nbsp;4.

<h2>3. The collection classes</h2>

Given that it is intended for an introductory data-structures course in
the style of <nobr>CS<font size=-3>&nbsp;</font>106B</nobr>, the
textbook spends most of its time on the fundamental structures that make
up the collection classes.
The fact that the textbook uses Stanford versions of
<a href="Vector-class.html"><code>Vector</code></a>,
<a href="Stack-class.html"><code>Stack</code></a>,
<a href="Queue-class.html"><code>Queue</code></a>,
<a href="Map-class.html"><code>Map</code></a>, and
<a href="Set-class.html"><code>Set</code></a>&mdash;as opposed to the
equally serviceable classes in the Standard Template Library&mdash;is
likely to represent a significant barrier to adoption for those who are
looking for a standard approach.

<p>In the early part of the summer, I played around with the idea of
using the STL collection classes in the text.
(The one extension I think is essential is <code>foreach</code>, but
Keith and I got <code>foreach</code> working with the STL classes over a
year ago.)
In the end, I decided against that path, although the factors that
turned out to pivotal in that decision were not the ones I had initially
expected.
I was willing to live with ungainly names like <code>push_back</code>
for vectors or using the verbs <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>
for queues.
I also figured out that I could hide the complexity of map iteration
(iteration in the STL steps through pairs with a
<code>first</code> and <code>second</code> component) by specializing
<code>foreach</code> to iterate over the keys in an STL map, just as it
does with our <code>Map</code> class.

<p>For me, there were three problems that seemed to be showstoppers.
First, the STL classes (at least by default) do very little checking
to ensure that arguments are valid.  Removing those checks gains some
efficiency, but can be disastrous for students.

<p>The second problem is that so many of the STL classes require the
use of iterators, even when no iteration is involved.  For example,
inserting or deleting an element from a vector requires the client
to use an iterator to indicate the position.  Similarly, the only way
to check for the existence of a key in a map requires the use of an
iterator.  Introducing iterators early represents a huge pedagogical
problem.  Syntactically, iterators in C++ resemble pointers, and it
therefore makes sense to introduce pointers before iterators, and therefore
before introducting any collection class that depends on iterators.  That
ordering, however, has proved to be problematic in the past.  When we
introduced the details of memory before presenting the client view of
collection classes, comprehension was dramatically lower than it has
been in recent years.

The third problem&mdash;and the one that actually pushed me over the
edge&mdash;is the definition of <code>pop</code> in the
<code>stack</code> and <code>queue</code> classes.
To avoid having to copy the result, the STL defines <code>pop</code> as
a procedure, forcing the client to read the value of <code>top</code>
(or <code>front</code>) prior to popping the value.
This design creates an asymmetry between <code>push</code> and
<code>pop</code> and will almost certainly discourage students from
thinking in terms of functional composition.

<p>Given these problems, I decided to introduce the Stanford versions of
the collection classes but to defend that decision on the grounds that
these simplified versions are easier to implement, not that they are
easier to understand.
The primary focus of the book is on understanding the implementation of
these structures, and I think I can convince instructors that there is
no need to implement all the features provided by the STL.

<p>As you can see in the individual descriptions that follow, I have
taken some steps (most notably in the <code>Map</code> class) to make
the STL and the Stanford versions more compatible, which should also
decrease the resistance to using these classes.

<p>In Version&nbsp;1.0 of this document, I asked whether anyone
"wanted to defend the idea that I should go with the
standard STL plus <code>foreach</code>."
The responses I received for the most part echoed my feeling that,
although such an idea initially seems attractive, it would end up
creating too many problems.
Jerry Cain expressed this position particularly well:

<blockquote>
I actually started to defend the idea, and I changed my mind.
:)  Even if you were to go with the standard templates, you'd probably
want to avoid iterators and install <code>containsKey</code> and
<code>contains</code> methods into the <code>map</code> and
<code>set</code>, and that alone is enough of a breakaway from the STL
mindset that you should just stick with the CS106 containers we know
have worked so wonderfully for the last 9 years.
</blockquote>

<h3>3.1 The <code>Vector</code> class</h3>

I've made a few changes to the
<a href="Vector-class.html"><code>Vector</code></a> class to bring it in
line with the STL.
First, I've included <code>push_back</code> as a synonym for
<code>add</code>.
Traditionalists can therefore stick with the STL nomenclature.
Second, I've shortened the names <code>getAt</code> and
<code>setAt</code> to <code>get</code> and <code>set</code>,
as suggested by several of you reviewing this document.

<p>More importantly, I've changed the interpretation of the
integer-argument constructor to match what the STL <code>vector</code>
does, which is at odds with the interpretation in the existing Stanford
libraries.
In our old libraries, the declaration

<pre>
    Vector<int> vec(10);
</pre>

sets the <i>capacity</i> of the vector.
In the STL version, this constructor performs the far more useful
operation of setting the <i>size.</i>
Each element of the vector is initialized to its default value or to a
specific initial value passed as an optional second argument to the
constructor.

<p>Following on a suggestion from Keith Schwarz, I've added to
<code>Vector</code> the overloaded <code>+</code> and <code>+=</code>
operators, which I had already added to the <code>Set</code> class.
Perhaps more importantly, I've overloaded the comma operator to
implement Keith's suggestion for a new syntax for initialization
of vectors:

<pre>
    Vector<int> digits;
    digits += 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;
</pre>


<h3>3.2 The <code>Stack</code> class</h3>

The <a href="Stack-class.html"><code>Stack</code></a> class is
essentially the same as it has been.
The only change is that I've added a <code>top</code> method that
returns the top element on the stack by reference, just as the STL
<code>top</code> method does.
I don't plan to cover this method in the textbook (mostly because
I think assigning to the top of the stack will confuse students about
the limits of the abstraction boundary), but did want to keep it there
for the traditionalists.
Having <code>top</code> in the interface means that the STL idiom for
popping a stack still works.

<h3>3.3 The <code>Queue</code> class</h3>

I've made only a minor change to the
<a href="Queue-class.html"><code>Queue</code></a> class, which is to add
the <code>front</code> and <code>back</code> methods from STL queues.

<p>Several people responded negatively to the idea of unifying the
queue and priority queue constructs, so I've separated them again.
The priority queue is included in the <code>SimpleCxxLib</code>
libraries as the class
<a href="PriorityQueue-class.html"><code>PriorityQueue</code></a>,
which is exported by the interface
<a href="pqueue.html"><code>pqueue.h</code></a>.

<h3>3.4 The <code>Map</code> class</h3>

The biggest changes in the collection class libraries are in the
<a href="Map-class.html"><code>Map</code></a> class.
At Steve's suggestion, I've restored the
<code>KeyType</code> template parameter so that maps work with arbitrary
keys, and not just strings.
In the process, it made sense to change the underlying implementation
from a hash table to a binary search tree (although I've added
separate <code>HashMap</code> and <code>HashSet</code> classes to the
libraries as well).
These changes bring our version of <code>Map</code> in line with the STL
<code>map</code> class.

<p>Making these changes to the <code>Map</code> class, however, has a
significant effect on the presentation in the text.
Unlike in the hash-table implementation, iterating over a map now
processes the keys in order, which lets me throw away a fair chunk of
the discussion of iterator order in Chapter&nbsp;5.
More importantly, the later chapters now approach the implementation of
the <code>Map</code> class through a series of approximations to the
final behavior.
The hash-table implementation offers constant time performance at the
cost of unordered iterators; the binary-tree implementation restores the
desired ordering constraint at the cost of making the time logarithmic.
This difference makes it possible for me to discuss tradeoffs between
these strategies in more detail.

<h3>3.5 The <code>Set</code> class</h3>

I've left the low-level parts of the
<a href="Set-class.html"><code>Set</code></a> class much as they were,
although the implementation is now based on the <code>Map</code> class
rather than <code>BST</code>, which no longer exists in the libraries as
an exported template class.
For compatibility with the STL, I've added <code>insert</code> as
a synonym for <code>add</code>.

<p>Along the same lines as described for the <code>Vector</code> class
earlier, I've overloaded the comma operator so that it works with
the <code>+=</code> to support a concise syntax for initializing sets:

<pre>
    Set<char> vowels;
    vowels += 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u';
</pre>

For sets, I've also extended <code>-=</code> to remove a comma-separated
list of elements.

<p>The changes that I've made in the <code>Set</code> class are in
the higher-level functions that I don't actually introduce until I
talk about the implementation of sets in Chapter&nbsp;17.
In the old version of the interface, these facilities were implemented
as named methods: <code>equals</code>, <code>unionWith</code>,
<code>intersectWith</code>, and <code>subtract</code>.
Those names were good choices when the package worked with an ADT in C,
but don't seem right for C++, where it seems more natural to use
operators for that purpose.

<p>I have therefore defined the following operators for the <code>Set</code>
class:

<div style="margin-left:3em;">
<table>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> == </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Set equality test</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> != </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Set inequality test</code></td>
</tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> + </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Union</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> * </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Intersection</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> - </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Set difference</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> += </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Union with</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> *= </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Intersect with</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> &ndash; </code><i>s<sub><font size=-1>2</font></sub></i></td>
<td>Set difference</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> += </code><i>element</i></td>
<td>Add element</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>s<sub><font size=-1>1</font></sub></i><code> &ndash;= </code><i>element</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>Remove element</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<h3>3.6 The <code>Grid</code> and <code>Lexicon</code> classes</h3>

In terms of the facilities exported by their interfaces, the
<a href="Grid-class.html"><code>Grid</code></a> and
<a href="Lexicon-class.html"><code>Lexicon</code></a> classes have not
changed in any significant way.
What has changed is the presentation in the textbook.
In the current version of the reader, each of these classes appears in
its own section in Chapter&nbsp;5.
This structure has always been slightly problematic because
<code>Lexicon</code> is not a template class in the way that the others
are.
My bigger concern, however, is that foregrounding these
classes&mdash;neither of which has a direct counterpart in the
STL&mdash;will increase the likelihood that potential adopters will
reject the presentation as nonstandard.
At the same time, I think that both of these classes are worth having
around, mostly because of the wonderful exercises that they enable.

<p>I believe that I can mitigate this danger by organizing
Chapter&nbsp;5 into five sections that individually cover the Stanford
versions of the essential collection classes from the STL
(<code>Vector</code>, <code>Stack</code>, <code>Queue</code>,
<code>Map</code>, and <code>Set</code>).
I then introduce <code>Grid</code> in the last subsection under
<code>Vector</code> as a simplification of a vector of vectors and
introduce <code>Lexicon</code> as a special enhancement of the
<code>Set</code> idea.

<h3>3.7 Iteration and <code>foreach</code></h3>

In a revision I've been planning to do for almost a year,
I've eliminated the <code>hasNext</code>/<code>next</code>
iterator model from the Stanford collection types and replaced it with
standard STL iterators.
I've also replaced my implementation of <code>foreach</code> with
Keith's extension that also works with strings and statically
initialized arrays.
Students, of course, aren't likely to use the underlying iterators
directly, although I do cover them in Chapter&nbsp;19.
Making that change, however, simplifies <code>foreach</code> because the
iterable types share a common model.
It also means that all of the STL algorithms work on our classes just as
they do on the standard ones.
For example, you can sort a <code>Vector</code> like this:

<pre>
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
</pre>

<h2>4. The graphics libraries</h2>

<p>A graphics library serves several purposes in an introductory CS
course and, as a result, must fit the needs of different audiences.
On the one hand, students would like to build interactive graphical
applications (such as Breakout) and therefore must be simple enough for
them to use.
On the other, we've always been happy to build some scaffolding as
part of an assignment (as in Yahtzee or Boggle) in which we, as
instructors, use more advanced features of the graphics packages to
design the user interface we want.
Ideally, the graphics package will be able to satisfy both needs.


<p>In Version 1.0 of this document, I had proposed replicating the Java
<code>GObject</code> model in C++.
Our experience in <nobr>CS<font size=-3>&nbsp;</font>106A</nobr> shows
that the model works well pedagogically and is easy for students to
understand.
Having done it, I can also attest that the model is implementable in
C++.
The fact that it can be done, however, is not in itself sufficient
reason to include it in the package.

<p>Based on the comments that came back in response to my query in
Version&nbsp;1.0, I've decided to eliminate the entire
<code>GObject</code> hierarchy on the grounds that

<ol>
<li>It introduces too many new classes.
<li>Its use of Java-like object semantics create too much confusion.
</ol>

<p>In the revised version of the package, the graphical capabilities are
exported through the <a href="gwindow.html"><code>gwindow.h</code></a> and
<a href="gevents.html"><code>gevents.h</code></a> interfaces.
The <code>GWindow</code> class uses a <i>persistent bitmap</i> to store
the screen image.  Under this model, the student calls graphics primitives to
draw on the canvas, and the implementation takes care of updating the
screen image on calls to <code>repaint</code> (formerly called
<code>updateDisplay</code>) or <code>pause</code>.
This model is illustrated by the following graphical version of the
"hello,&nbsp;world" program, which centers its message on a
magenta oval at the center of the window:

<pre class=codefigure>
<span class=comment>/*
 * File: HelloWorld.cpp
 * --------------------
 * This program draws the message "hello, world" on top of a
 * magenta oval in the center of the graphics window.  This
 * version uses the simple gwindow.h model that draws on a
 * persistent canvas.
 */</span>

#include "gwindow.h"
using namespace std;

int main() {
   GWindow gw;
   double xc = gw.getWidth() / 2;
   double yc = gw.getHeight() / 2;
   string msg = "hello, world";
   gw.setColor("MAGENTA");
   gw.fillOval(xc - 100, yc - 50, 200, 100);
   gw.setColor("BLACK");
   gw.setFont("Helvetica-24");
   gw.drawString(msg, xc - gw.getStringWidth(msg) / 2, yc + 0.40 * 24);
   return 0;
}
</pre>

When the student runs this program, the output looks like this:

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/HelloWorld.png" width=50%>
</center>

<p>This model of a persistent-bitmap worked extremely well in the years
that the <nobr>CS<font size=-3>&nbsp;</font>106</nobr> was in C.
The biggest problem is that animation is problematic.
The contents of the graphics window are painted on the offscreen buffer,
so the strategy for animation is to erase the old image, draw the new
one, and pause.
That strategy is inadequate for any serious animation, but works well
for drawing static pictures, which is mostly what I need for the
<nobr>CS<font size=-3>&nbsp;</font>106B</nobr> book.
